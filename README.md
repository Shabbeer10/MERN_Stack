## Introduction

This website - ReSource - is a simple MERN stack application. It leverages MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js to provide a full-stack development experience. My focus was learning to implement these technologies together successfully first, rather than robust UI/UX. I focus on that as time goes on.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming
- **CORS**: Crucial for enabling web applications to interact with resources hosted on different domains

## Features

- Ability to Add, Edit and Delete records.
- Data is updated on MongoDB database.

## Eventual Features

- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- Responsive design and improved UI/UX

## Installation

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or use a cloud solution like MongoDB Atlas)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install -D
   ```

3. **Run the server with**:

   ```bash
